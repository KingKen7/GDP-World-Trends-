Project One Proposal

Topic:  Data Exploration of trends in: Poorest countries in continents with High GDPs
(Intent will be to incorporate different elements of first six weeks of training, Must use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook).

Project Description / Outline


1.	Summary: We are looking to explore the World Bank GDP rankings to determine what global regions have the lowest ranking vs the highest. Evaluating the trends in the data (“including outliers”) to see which region shows strongest growth verses weakest.  
		

2.	Data:  We will use the world bank open data source, obtaining the datasets via Kaggle.com(https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/world-bank-gdp-ranking?select=gdp-ppp-csv-.csv), this dataset seems to provide the team with clear classifications. As well as positioned to provide us with the 200-300 data points required for this particular project. 


3.	Analysis: Through the exploration of this data we expect to obtain the ability to conclusively say one global region’s GDP is higher than the next. This analysis will be both through numerical data, and graph production.
